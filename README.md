## Project : Memory Matrix Challenge

### Overview
Memory Matrix Challenge aims to enhance cognitive skills through engaging memory exercises. The project integrates design patterns like Singleton, Observer, and Strategy, complemented by Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), to build robust and scalable game functionality.

### Team Members:
- Suman Upreti
- Sultan Alfoory
- Sunyojita Rattu

### Directory Structure
The project is organized as follows:
- `src/main/java/memoryMatrix` contains the core game logic.
- `src/test/java/memoryMatrix` houses our test suites, aiming for at least 80% method coverage.

### Testing
We've achieved % method coverage, ensuring that all functionalities are thoroughly verified. This commitment to testing underpins the reliability and stability of our game.

### Game Mechanics
- **Pattern Recognition**: Players are challenged to memorize and replicate patterns, enhancing their memory skills.
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: The game adjusts its difficulty based on the player's performance, ensuring a continually engaging experience.

### Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
BDD has been employed to articulate game functionalities in human-readable terms, ensuring that development efforts align closely with intended game behaviors.

### Design Patterns
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a single instance of the game's core logic, providing a unified control point across the application.
- **Observer Pattern**: Enables real-time updates to the UI and game state in response to player actions, enhancing the interactive experience.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Allows for the flexible implementation of game mechanics, enabling a varied gameplay experience through different strategies.

### Java Version
- The game is developed using Java SE 17.
- VM: OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM by JetBrains s.r.o., ensuring a stable and efficient development environment.

"Memory Matrix Challenge" is dedicated to providing a compelling platform for cognitive enhancement through interactive and enjoyable gameplay.
